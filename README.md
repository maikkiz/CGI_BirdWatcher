# CGI Future Talent 2020 pre-assignment
## Exercise 4 - BirdWatcher app (Application for saving bird observations)

## Features of the app
- List of bird observations including name of the species, rarity, notes, timestamp and coordinates of the observation, ordered by timestamp (id).
- Adding new observations
- Saving the observations in local SQLite database
- Deleting observation

## The application is created with React Native and Expo CLI

## To install and run the application you need Git, Node.js, Expo CLI and Expo app (instructions for installing these following)

### Instructions for installing Git for Windows
Download the git installer from https://gitforwindows.org/ and follow it's instructions.

### Instructions for installing node.js
Download the node.js installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow it's instructions.

### Instructions for installing Expo CLI
Open your terminal and run the following command on it `npm install -g expo-cli`.

### Instructions for installing Expo app (Android/Apple)
Open Google Play Store / AppStore in your mobile, search for Expo and download the app.

## Instructions for installing and running the application

### Step 1
The easiest way to get the project is to clone it. Create an empty folder and open the Git-terminal (for example GitBash) on it. Then clone the project using following command `git clone https://github.com/maikkiz/CGI_BirdWatcher.git`.

### Step 2
Navigate to the cloned project folder and open your (PowerShell)-terminal

### Step 3
To install the needed dependencies execute the following command in your terminal `npm install`.

### Step 4
Now you can start up the application by writing the following command to the terminal `expo start`, it will open expo's own terminal to web browser on port localhost:19002.

Switch the connection from LAN to Tunnel from the left side of the browser just above the QR-code. You can also use LAN but then your computer and mobile should be on the same network. Wait until it reads 'Tunnel ready' in your expo terminal.

### Step 5
Open the Expo app in your mobile, navigate to the Projects view and scan the QR-code from the expo terminal by pressing 'Scan QR Code' on the app. Now the application should start building on your mobile and should be ready for testing after few seconds (and sometimes after few seconds more).

## My experience with the assingment
When the pre-assingments came I was really excited to see that the exercise four was about mobile and web development because those are the things that I'm the most interested in. I have just completed a mobile programming course so everything is clear in my memory and I felt confident about going on with the exercise.

I enjoyed working with the project and I'm pleased with what I created. I would have wanted to add a feature that the user could add a picture to the observation and I tried to, but it didn't work and I run out of time so I had to leave that out.

All in all it was fun doing the pre-assingment and I really hope that you are pleased with it and hopefully I become part of your team.
